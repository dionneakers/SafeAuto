# SafeAuto

This is my first time being exposed to the .NET framework as well as C# and I didn't grasp the concepts as easily as I'd like to, so that I could complete this challenge. 

My approach to this challenge was to understand the concepts that I learned, utilizing Microsoft Docs for C#, instead of trying to find snippets of the code and using them as my own without any understanding.
